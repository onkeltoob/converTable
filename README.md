converTable
===========

This plugin provides functionality to convert tabular data into a list of definitions 
where each table row holds one cell for the definition term while the other cells are 
being converted to one definition item each. This may not be semantically perfect, but 
since it doesn't seem totally off in a lot of cases it can come in handy when dealing  
with lots of columns on smaller screens. 

Don't blame me for anything, I simply don't know any better.
